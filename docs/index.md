<p>A ROS2 package which can be used to control the legged robot <b>Unitree Go1 Edu</b> using ROS topics.</p>
</div>

This package acts has middleware between ROS2 and `unitree_legged_sdk`, which enables
anyone to control the robot with velocity commands as well as receive back the robot state. Furthermore, additional features are also available such as standing up/down the robot and use head LEDs for some status information.

!!! NOTE

    Only supports `unitree_legged_sdk` High level commands

## ⚙️ Installation <a id="installation"></a>

This package is available in the ROS index for both Iron and Humble distributions.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-[distro]-unitree-ros
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using **foxy** as your ROS distribution, you need to build from source

### 📦 Installation From Source <a id="installation-from-source"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to clone it recursively, as depends on the `unitree_legged_sdk`.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/unitree_ws/src
cd ~/unitree_ws/src
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/snt-arg/unitree_ros.git
```

Once you have cloned this repository, you will need to build it using Colcon.

```sh
cd ~/unitree_ws
source /opt/ros/[ros-distro]/setup.bash # or zsh if using the zsh shell!
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash # or zsh if using the zsh shell!
```

After having built the workspace, you should now be able to use the driver to control your robot.

## 🚀 Usage <a id="usage"></a>

You can use this driver wired or with a Wi-Fi connection. By default, it is set to use the wired connection.

To launch the driver, you can use the launch file available. For a wired connection use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch unitree_ros unitree_driver_launch.py
```

For a Wi-Fi connection use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch unitree_ros unitree_driver_launch.py wifi:=true
```

In case you prefer to modify more parameters, you can do so by passing the parameters file. The default parameters can be found in `config/params.yaml` or [here](#ros-parameters).

```bash
ros2 launch unitree_ros unitree_driver_launch.py params_file:="path_to_your_params_file" #wifi:=true/false
```

## 🛠️ Features <a id="features"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> In the next version, joint states will also be available.

### 💡 Robot LED statuses <a id="robot-led-statuses"></a>

The robot has a few predetermined LED statuses, which are useful to give some information to
anyone using the robot.
The following statuses are available:

- 🟢 **Green Light**: Ready status

    <img src="./assets/ready_status.gif" width="150" height="150"/>

- ⚪️ **White Light**: Idle status

    <img src="./assets/idle_status.gif" width="150" height="150"/>

- 🔵 **Blue Light**: Moving status

    <img src="./assets/moving_status.gif" width="150" height="150"/>

- 🟡 **Yellow Light**: Low battery _(< 30 %)_

    <img src="./assets/low_battery_status.gif" width="150" height="150"/>

### 🪫 Low Battery Protection <a id="low-battery-protection"></a>

By specifying a low battery threshold using the parameters file (`low_batt_shutdown_threshold`), the driver will stop the robot
from moving and will stand it down. _By default, the low battery threshold value is set to 20%._

### 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance <a id="obstacle-avoidance"></a>

The robot has an obstacle avoidance mode. However, this mode is not enabled by default. Therefore,
this driver allows you to enable it using the parameters file (`use_obstacle_avoidance`). _By default, this is
set to false_

This package was developed for the Autonomous Robotics Group (ARG) from the University of Luxembourg.

#### Maintainers

#### Third-party Assets

- [unitree_legged_sdk](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk): This is the SDK provided by the Unitree robotics. It is being used to send/receive all the High level commands to/from the robot.

- **`faceLightSDK_nano`**: This is the SDK that can be found on the internal computers of the Unitree Go1. It has been ported to this ROS package with the goal of being able to control the face LEDs, which are used to
  give some robot statuses.
